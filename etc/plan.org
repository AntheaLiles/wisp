** Keys

 - An object can have a unique identifier called a `key`.

 - The key is random and presented in a short text format.

 - The key is 64 bits: 16 timestamp bits and 48 random bits.
   - The timestamp is the number of days since 2022-01-01.
   - The random bits should be cryptographic, but whatever.

 - A key looks like: `~20220314.8NJAFJ7WJF`.
   - The date is UTC YYYYMMDD.
   - The random bits are uppercase ZB32.
   - The format is URL safe.

 - Keys are used for linking.

 - Keys can be used as stable pointers.

 - Keys are stored in source code.

 - Keys can be generated in the IDE.

 - Keys are read as interned symbols in the KEY package.
   - The key symbol's value is a KEY struct with a 64-bit V08.

** Docs
 - An object can have a documentation value called a `doc`.

 - Objects with docs also have keys.

 - Keys are used for generating URLs.
